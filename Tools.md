# Tooling Suggestions

## Sublime Text
I use the multiple cursors available in Sublime all the time. It's easier to debug than putting things in an Excel doc and trying to construct SQL using `CONCATENATE`.

* Title case shortcut
* Highlight to next word
* Highlight to beginning and end of line
* Split selection into lines
* Delete blank lines
* Insert snippets

## Postman
Runs end to end tests on APIs. Can also be used to play with third party APIs, and then generate code in one of several different languages that will execute the same API call that you set up in your request. I tried to include Postman collections on the [Document Documentation] ('DocumentDocumentation.md')
